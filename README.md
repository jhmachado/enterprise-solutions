# Enterprise Solutions

## About

This is a project were I use new tools and techniques to solve problems
that I've encounter in my carrer. This problems were created in different
scenarios and in different companies with different demands.

### Resources

The main resource is the Laravel framework, in the past I've used other
frameworks like CodeIgniter and Symfony, but they were always missing a
few resources that the Laravel framework has on its own.

### Techniques

Now, the first technique (and the most important one) is the DDD approach
in the project. Not because it wasn't used in other situations, but simply
because it will be a large code base on its own.
